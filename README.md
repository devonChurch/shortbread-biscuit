# Shortbread Biscuit 🍰 🍞 🍪 😋

## What 👋

An application that allows a user to investigate every [New Zealand Lotto](https://mylotto.co.nz/) result in detail.

+ 📊 _Balls_ are compartmentalised into their specific _draw_ order and then ranked by _frequency_.

+ 🎛 A _**"Most Frequent"**_ section is also generated by aggregating all drawn _ball_ frequencies regardless of _draw_ order.

## Demo 👀

#### You can view an [interactive demo here](https://devonchurch.github.io/shortbread-biscuit/) 😊

### Custom Selection

Users can select specific _ball_ numbers and observe their influence over the entire _draw_ spectrum.

### Time Periods

The _draw_ records can also be time sliced to better understand how certain _ball_ numbers rank at different periods in time.
