## What 👋

An application that allows a user to investigate every [New Zealand Lotto](https://mylotto.co.nz/) result in detail.

- 📊 _Balls_ are compartmentalised into their specific _draw_ order and then ranked by _frequency_.

- 🎛 A _**"Most Frequent"**_ section is also generated by aggregating all drawn _ball_ frequencies regardless of _draw_ order.

- ⚖ _Ball_ combinations are ranked by _size_ and _frequency_ regardless of ball order.

- 📋 _Draws_ are ranked in sequential order. This is a great way to cross reference _**combinations**_ and _ball_ _**frequencies**_.

## Demo 👀

#### You can view an [interactive demo here](https://devonchurch.github.io/shortbread-biscuit/) 😊

### Web Worker

As of release `v1.1.0` [Web Workers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webworkers) are used to shift CPU heavy computation onto another thread 🎉

The workers progress is streamed back to the main application thread and an real time indicator is shown to the user ⏱

### Custom Selection

Users can select specific _ball_ numbers and observe their influence over the entire _draw_ spectrum.

### Time Periods

The _draw_ records can also be time sliced to better understand how certain _ball_ numbers rank at different periods in time.
